A basic website for me to host my projects -- Feel free to copy my code without credit, I don't care :)

This website is currently under development, so nothing is operational on the site besides a few cookie-cutter 2012 html pages

At the time of writing this (and don't ask me how) the website doesn't work at all, don't ask me how
