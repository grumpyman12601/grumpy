<h2> Welcome to the Grumpy Blog</h2>
<p1> This is the start of the Grumpy Blog. I will be going over the programs I'm developing, news in the tech community, and random shit I think could be fun to talk about. Expect a LOT of rants on here. </p1>

<h3> The First Entry </h3>
<p1> I made my website yesterday, got a lot of the basics done but I need to learn more CSS to edit the style of this website. I want it to be a project I get out the second I can, and then just update it with continuous updates</p1>
